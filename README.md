# Vehicle Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Using R
Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a vehicle dataset using the R programming language and R Studio. The goal was to perform detailed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced machine learning techniques to derive valuable insights about vehicle pricing, market trends, and various influencing factors.

The project demonstrates my ability to clean, manipulate, and visualize data, apply clustering techniques, and build predictive models using R. It includes a wide range of tasks such as data wrangling, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, performing clustering, and creating insightful visualizations to understand the relationships within the data.
