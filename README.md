# Vehicle Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Using R

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a vehicle dataset using the R programming language and RStudio. The main goal is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning techniques to gain insights into vehicle pricing trends, market segmentation, and other key factors that influence vehicle pricing.

Key tasks include:
- Data import, cleaning, and summarization
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical data
- Visualizations of relationships between features
- Clustering analysis to identify patterns in the dataset
- Predictive modeling to understand the factors influencing car prices
